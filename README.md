### Description:
The application will allow the users to track their incomes and expenses. Users will be able to see some statistics for the previous months and review their spending habits based on their most expensive spending categories.
Users will be able to perform basic CRUD operations among their expenses/incomes and expense/income categories. Users should also be able to see some generated statistics for the current or some of the previous months. The application will allow users pre-define regular monthly expenses (like rent, internet etc.), which will then be automatically accounted for in their calculated budget.
